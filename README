VR
_Writing_
Writing up bare bones of 1st VR paper, aiming for mid-February for first draft
1st paper - aud/vis + 2 position depth oddball
2nd paper 5-depth

Experiment
Final Version done by Monday, through running pilots we found a few more aspects that are worth investing in at this point (better tutorial construction, reducing trial numbers)

Next version? We will have data all collected by the middle of March at the latest, I think it might be best to spend some time while collecting to develop the next VR experiment, so that middle March to April we can collect data for another paper, can spend the spring writing up papers.

Analysis
Adapting changes from experiment in analysis as I rework the experiment, developing together so I donâ€™t have to back.
