Event trigger numbers picked up by the Amp (coloumn 1)
Events types are either ON (onset) Resp (response) OFF (offset) at one of 5 depths (coloumn 2)
Triggers are recoded for convience by the matlab preprocessing script at line 60 - 90 (coloumn 3)

Depth 1 is the orb at the depth nearest to participant 
Depth 5 is the orb at the depth farthest to the participant
In the Near condition the target is the orb at Depth 1, and all other Depth orbs are standards
In the Far condition the target is the orb at Depth 5, and all other Depth orbs are standards
